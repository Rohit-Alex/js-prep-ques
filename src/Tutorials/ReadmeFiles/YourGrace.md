Like a sudden gust of wind,
You came into my life, unforeseen.
With every moment spent in your sight,
All else pales, nothing seems right.

Your beauty and grace, like a beacon shine,
A radiance that captures this heart of mine.
Talking to you, my heart leaps with joy,
A connection that time could never destroy.

Without hesitation, I choose you first,
Above all others, my love is dispersed.
But now, I must face this harsh truth,
A future with you, a fleeting sleuth.

But now, with a heavy heart, I must confess,
That holding on to you brings me distress.
For as much as I yearn to hold you tight,
I know deep down, it's not meant to be right.

Leaving you, always a bitter pill,
A failure that haunts me still.
But this time, I know what I must do,
Let you go, to find what's true.

Our time together, a precious memory,
But my heart must move on, it's destiny.
Though it hurts to say goodbye,
I'll always love you, beyond the sky
