Datatypes
typeof => Returns the datatype of the variable. It's return string.
Difference between null and undefined
instanceof: Mentioned key points in Notes.md (Pt. 4)

typeof null => 'object'
    -->>This is because in the implementation of the language, the type of null is represented by a bit pattern that is the same as    the bit pattern used to represent an object reference. This mistake was made in the early days of JavaScript development.


truthy/falsy
Operators (>, <, <=, >=, ||, &&, ==, === !, comma, ??, =, isNaN(a), Number.isNaN(a))
    --->>> Exponential operator
            the unique exponentiation operator has right-associativity, whereas other arithmetic operators have left-associativity.
            const a = 4 ** 3 ** 2; // Same as 4 ** (3 ** 2); evaluates to 262144
    --->>> Assignment operator is explained in Notes.md pt.31
    --->>> isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number
    --->>> Number.isNaN() doesn't attempt to convert the parameter to a number, so non-numbers always return false
    --->>> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN
    
Ternary operator:

    --->>> c ? p : q     <====> (c && p) || (!c && q)

    --->>> c ? true : p  <====> (c || p)
    --->>> c ? p : true  <====> (!c || p)

    --->>> c ? false : p <====> (!c && p)
    --->>> c ? p : false <====> (c && p)

    e.g. 
    boolean b;
    if (i > 5) {
        b = (j == 3);
    } else {
        b = false;
    }

    equivalent to: boolean b = (i > 5) && (j == 3)

coercion
    --->>> == and === (in details using coercion)
    --->>> https://javascript.info/comparison
    --->>> null and undefined equal each other and donâ€™t equal anything else.
    --->>> [null].toString() => ''
           [undefined].toString() => ''
           [] => in number is equivalent to 0

var,let,const
How are we able to change a constant variable with array but not a variable having primitive value?

Objects, Maps 
    --->>> Go through their differences. Which one to use and when.
    --->>> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
    --->>> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map (Difference is also provided)

Object.Freeze vs Object.Seal
    --->>> Seal => Naruto sealing corpses
                => can't add or remove any properties.
                => However, can change the existing properties.

           Freeze => Max privacy in object
                  => Can't add, modify or delete any properties.
                  => Only applicable at top level. i.e. Shallow freezing
